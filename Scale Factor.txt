Hi,

it´s quite easy to calculate the acceleration for every axis. Put your accelerometer flat on the table.
It will output the bias values for X- and Y-axis (acc_x_bias). If you are using a 3-axis accelerometer, then the Z-axis will output the value for -1g.

Now rotate the a accelerometer 90 degrees X-axis up. You get the +1g value (acc_x_1g) for the X-axis. Do this for every axis.

With these calculations you get the acceleration in g and finally the angle in degrees.

sf_x = 9.80666 / (acc_x_1g - acc_x_bias); // Calculate the scale factor for X-axis
acc_x = sf_x * (adc_x_reading - acc_x_bias); // Calculate the actual acceleration of X-axis
angle_x = asin(acc_x / 9.80666) * 180.0 / PI;

Be aware that a calibration routine for high performance devices are much more complex, but for simple applications this should fit.
